\title{Locally best invariant test against a change in persistence}
\usage{
LBI_test(x, trend = c("none", "linear"), tau = 0.2,
  statistic = c("mean", "max", "exp"), m = 0, simu = 0, M = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the univariate numeric time series to be investigated.}

\item{trend}{whether the time series exhibits a trend, \code{none} implies no trend and \code{linear} implies a linear trend.}

\item{tau}{the function tests in the interval \code{[T*tau,T*(1-tau)]} for a break in persistence with T being the length of the time series. It must hold that \code{0<tau<0.5}, default is \code{tau=0.2} as commonly used in the literature.}

\item{statistic}{which type of test statistic should be used, \code{mean} corresponds to Hansen's (1991) mean score, \code{max} to Andrews' (1993) maximum statistic, and \code{exp} to Andrews and Ploberger's (1994) mean-exponential statistic}

\item{m}{Number of covariances used for the estimation of the long run variance. Default is \code{m=0}.}

\item{simu}{whether critical values should be simulated or interpolated, \code{simu=1} means simulation, \code{simu=0} means interpolation. See details. Default is \code{simu=0}.}

\item{M}{number of replications in case critical values should be simulated. Default is \code{M=10000}.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix that consists of test statistic and critical values (corresponding to \code{alpha=0.1,0.05,0.01}) for testing against a change from I(1) to I(0), I(0) to I(1), and against a change in an unknown direction.
}
\description{
This function performs the locally best invariant test against a change in persistence as suggested by Busetti and Taylor (2004). Under the null hypothesis the time series is I(0) throughout and
under the alternative a change from either I(1) to I(0) or I(0) to I(1) has occured.
}
\details{
The critical values of the tests vary with the sample size. If \code{simu=0}, the critical values provided
are based on linear interpolation of the critical values simulated by Busetti and Taylor (2004). These are based on \code{tau=0.2}. If \code{simu=1},
the critical values are simulated based on the given data using M replications. Caution, for large M this might take a while,
small M, however, make the results unreliable.
